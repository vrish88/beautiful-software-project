          Uh oh, looks like the mobile browser location isn't 100% accurate. In
          some tests that I did, the location of the feelings on the map were
          off.
        </p>

        <p>
          We might need to give the user a chance to refine the feeling so that
          they can adjust the it before getting "commited".

          How could we use a sequence to instruct the user how to assess the
          environment?

        <p>Does a user need to know about the aggregated data?</p>

        <p>How could a user change their feeling for a place?</p>

          Hookay, I've been trying to get faster feedback configuring the map.
          It had this kinda weird fuzzy white-ish outline that wasn't very easy
          to see at a high zoom. To test it, each time I had to add a couple
          feelings and then load the map. To skip those steps I just created a
          new button, just for me :) to create the map with some preset data.
          This had the interesting side-effect of having better factored code,
          with the <code>createMap</code> function and maybe it'll also help
          give demos of what a feelings map might look like.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another thought that I had while reading a
          <a
            href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2021/100-things-every-web-developer-should-know/"
            >blog post</a
          >
          was that maybe we could start by importing and exporting files? It
          turns out the
          <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#addsource"
            ><code>addSource</code> function from MapBox</a
          >
          is able to load the geojson data from a file.
          <a
            href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/geojson.htm"
            >GeoJSON</a
          >
          is effectively a data file format that encodes geospatial data.
        </p>

        <p>The workflow would look something like this</p>

        <ol>
          <li>On their phone a user maps out a couple feelings</li>
          <li>
            When they are done, we give them a file to download with their
            mapping
          </li>
          <li>They save that to their phone, can email it to others, etc</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This would have a couple of benefits as a way to start:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>It would be cheap because we wouldn't need to store any data.</li>
          <li>It would be extensible because users could share data.</li>
          <li>There might be existing tools that work with geojson files.</li>
        </ol>
